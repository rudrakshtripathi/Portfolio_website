## 🌟 Welcome to My Interactive Portfolio!

Greetings, fellow tech explorer!  
I’m **Rudraksh Tripathi**, and you’ve just stepped into an **AI-powered, terminal-inspired space** crafted for genuine connection and discovery. Instead of another static website, enjoy an experience—*my story, skills, and projects—one command at a time!*

## ✨ What Makes This Portfolio Unique?

- **💡 Terminal Aesthetic**  
  Old-school charm meets modern flair: green-on-black UI, blinking caret, and animated badge.  
- **🤖 AI at Your Fingertips**  
  Type `help` for a list of commands. Dive into curated sections like `skills`, `projects`, `leadership`, `contact`, and more!
- **🎲 Dynamic & Fun**  
  Try the secret `sudo` command for a surprise.  
- **💬 Real-time Dialogue**  
  Every answer feels like chatting in a hacker’s den—retro, responsive, and intelligent.
